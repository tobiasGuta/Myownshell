# webshell.php
This tool is a simple webshell that allows a user to execute commands directly from a web interface. The webpage has a terminal-like appearance, where the user can input commands into a text box and submit them via a form. Once a command is submitted, the PHP script processes the input using shell_exec(), executes the command on the server, and displays the output in the terminal area on the page.
